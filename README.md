# NexusAutoClicker
 An autoclicker for nexusmods which clicks the slow download button for you. Mainly used for those long Wabbajack lists.

 (Updated to bypass the button changing colors)

 Features:
 - random intervals between clicks
 - random mouse placement on the button
 - cursor moving to the button at randomized speed
 - button on window to select "download button" region
 
.exe file is in the dist folder, packaged with pyinstaller, or you can just run the python script

 I don't really hear that many reports of people getting banned, and this program is especially careful about it, however
# Warning
 Understand that the use of an autoclicker violates nexusmods TOS and if they detect it, you WILL be BANNED.
