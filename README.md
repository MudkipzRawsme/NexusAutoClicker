# NexusAutoClicker
 A simple autoclicker which clicks the slow download button for you. Clicks between random intervals and random locations.
 
 Currently requires an IDE to run (Pycharm). Will implement an exe version later when I feel like it

 Instructions are all in the main.py file which you run
 
# Warning
 Understand that the use of a autoclicker violates nexusmods TOS and if they detect it, you WILL be banned
