# NexusAutoClicker

 Understand that the use of a autoclicker violates nexusmods TOS and WILL get you banned

 A simple autoclicker which clicks the slow download button for you. Clicks between random intervals and random locations 
 
 Currently requires an IDE to run (Pycharm). Will implement an exe version later when I feel like it

 Instructions are all in the main.py file
